## 💡 Key Concepts

### Design System
A comprehensive set of reusable components and styles that ensure consistency across the website.

**Components include:**
- Buttons (primary, secondary, sizes)
- Cards (basic, with gradient, with icons)
- Typography (headings, body text, gradient text)
- Layout (containers, grids, spacing)
- Header & Navigation

### CSS Architecture
Organized into logical folders:
- **base/** - Foundation (variables, reset, typography)
- **components/** - Reusable UI elements
- **layout/** - Page structure and spacing
- **utilities/** - Helper classes

### Responsive Design
- Desktop: Full features, horizontal layouts
- Tablet: Adapted layouts
- Mobile: Vertical stacks, hamburger menu

1. Change stylesheet link to `css/modern-styles.css`
2. Wrap content in cards
3. Update buttons to use `.btn-primary` class
4. Test on mobile

See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for detailed instructions.

# Phase 1: Student Database Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of Phase 1 of the Student Check-in System: **Student Database**.

**Implementation Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Git Branch:** `migrate-student-info-to-firestore`

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Firestore Data Structure

**Collection:** `students`

**Document Structure:**
```javascript
{
  // Student Information
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  email: string,
  phoneNumber: string,
  pronouns: string,
  
  // Consent & Confirmation
  over16Confirmed: boolean,
  emailConsent: boolean,  // Permission to send marketing emails
  
  // Admin Use
  adminNotes: string,  // Free text notes (admin only)
  
  // Timestamps
  registeredAt: Timestamp,  // When they submitted the form
  createdAt: Timestamp,     // Firestore server timestamp
  updatedAt: Timestamp      // Firestore server timestamp
}
```

**Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore

---

### 2. Files Created

#### HTML Pages
- **`/register.html`** - Student registration form (dual-purpose: admin & public)
- **`/admin/student-database.html`** - Student list view page (admin only)

#### CSS Styles
- **`/admin/student-database.css`** - Styling for student database and registration pages

#### JavaScript
- **`/js/register.js`** - Registration form logic with Firebase integration
- **`/admin/student-database.js`** - Student list view logic with Firestore queries

#### Modified Files
- **`/admin/index.html`** - Added "Student Database" tile
- **`/admin/admin.js`** - Added navigation handler for Student Database
- **`/admin/admin.css`** - Added color scheme for Student Database tile

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. **Admin User:**
   - Logged in via Firebase Auth
   - Can access `/admin/student-database.html`
   - Form shows admin-only elements
   - Duplicate name warnings enabled

2. **Public User:**
   - Not authenticated
   - Can access `/register.html` directly
   - No admin elements visible
   - No duplicate warnings
   - Silent registration

### Firestore Queries
- **List all students:** Ordered by `registeredAt` (newest first)
- **Duplicate check:** Query by `firstName` AND `lastName`
- **Auto-generated IDs:** Using Firestore's default document ID generation

### Styling
- **Color Scheme:** Urban Swing gradient (Pink ‚Üí Purple ‚Üí Blue)
- **Consistent with:** Existing admin portal styling
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first design
- **Dark Mode:** Supports system preference

## Data Migration Notes

### From Google Sheets to Firestore:
When ready to migrate existing student data from Google Sheets:

1. Export Google Sheets to CSV
2. Create migration script to:
   - Parse CSV data
   - Map columns to Firestore fields
   - Set appropriate timestamps
   - Batch upload to `students` collection
3. Verify data integrity
4. Keep Google Sheets as backup

**Note:** Migration script not yet created (pending Phase 1 testing).

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ Admin pages protected by Firebase Authentication
- ‚úÖ Firestore security rules required (not yet implemented)
- ‚úÖ Input sanitization via `escapeHtml()` function
- ‚úÖ Form validation on client-side
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO:** Server-side validation via Firebase Functions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO:** Firestore security rules to prevent unauthorized writes

### Recommended Firestore Security Rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Students collection
    match /students/{studentId} {
      // Allow authenticated admins to read/write
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      
      // Allow anyone to create (public registration)
      // But only specific fields
      allow create: if request.resource.data.keys().hasAll([
        'firstName', 'lastName', 'email', 'phoneNumber', 
        'over16Confirmed', 'emailConsent', 'registeredAt'
      ]);
    }
  }
}
```

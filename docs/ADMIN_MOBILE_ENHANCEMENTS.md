# Admin Portal Mobile Enhancements

## Overview
This document describes the mobile enhancements implemented for the Urban Swing admin portal, specifically the hamburger menu navigation system for mobile devices.

## Implementation Date
October 27, 2025

## Files Created

### 1. `admin/admin-mobile.css`
Mobile-specific stylesheet containing:
- Hamburger menu button styles
- Mobile navigation drawer (slide-in from right)
- Mobile navigation overlay (backdrop)
- Responsive adjustments for mobile screens
- Accessibility features (focus states, reduced motion support)

### 2. `admin/admin-mobile.js`
JavaScript module for mobile navigation functionality:
- `MobileNavigation` class that manages the hamburger menu
- Auto-initialization when user logs in
- Event handlers for menu open/close
- Responsive behavior (closes on resize to desktop)
- Keyboard navigation support (ESC to close)

## Features

### Hamburger Menu
- **Position**: Top right of header on mobile devices
- **Animation**: Smooth transformation to X icon when open
- **Trigger**: Shows automatically on screens ≤768px wide

### Mobile Navigation Drawer
- **Style**: Slides in from the right side
- **Width**: 80% of screen width (max 320px)
- **Background**: Gradient matching Urban Swing brand colors
- **Contents**:
  - User profile section with email
  - Logout button
  - Navigation menu with icons
  - Footer with version info

### User Experience
1. **Opening Menu**:
   - Tap hamburger icon
   - Overlay appears behind drawer
   - Drawer slides in from right
   - Body scroll is disabled

2. **Closing Menu**:
   - Tap hamburger icon again
   - Tap overlay/backdrop
   - Press ESC key
   - Tap a navigation link
   - Resize window to desktop size

3. **Navigation**:
   - Active page is highlighted
   - Each menu item has an icon and label
   - Smooth transitions and hover effects

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-expanded`)
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management (first menu item gets focus when opened)
- Reduced motion support for users who prefer it
- Clear visual focus indicators

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Desktop (>768px)**: Shows standard horizontal navigation, hides hamburger
- **Tablet/Mobile (≤768px)**: Shows hamburger menu, hides desktop navigation
- **Small Mobile (≤480px)**: Drawer width increased to 90%

## Integration

### Updated Files
1. **`admin/index.html`**:
   - Added `<link rel="stylesheet" href="admin-mobile.css">` in the `<head>`
   - Added `<script src="admin-mobile.js"></script>` before closing `</body>`

2. **Existing Styles**:
   - Desktop navigation styles remain unchanged in `admin.css`
   - Mobile-specific styles are isolated in `admin-mobile.css`
   - No conflicts with existing desktop functionality

## Technical Details

### Menu State Management
```javascript
class MobileNavigation {
  - constructor(): Initializes the menu system
  - init(): Creates DOM elements and sets up listeners
  - createMobileNav(): Builds hamburger button, overlay, and drawer
  - createDrawerContent(): Generates menu HTML with user info
  - toggleMenu(): Opens/closes the menu
  - openMenu(): Shows drawer with animations
  - closeMenu(): Hides drawer and restores focus
  - handleMobileLogout(): Handles logout from mobile menu
  - updateUserEmail(): Updates displayed email after login
}
```

### Auto-Initialization
- Mobile nav initializes automatically after Firebase authentication
- Updates user email and admin permissions dynamically
- Handles cases where Firebase auth may not be immediately available

### Performance
- Event listeners are properly scoped to prevent memory leaks
- Resize events are debounced (250ms) to prevent excessive calls
- Menu animations use CSS transitions for smooth 60fps performance

## Permissions
The Admin Tools menu item is only shown to authorized users (dance@urbanswing.co.nz), matching the desktop behavior.

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)
- CSS Transitions and Transforms

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Swipe gestures to open/close drawer
2. Touch-friendly tap targets (already implemented at 48x48px minimum)
3. Progressive web app (PWA) installation prompt
4. Offline mode indicator
5. Dark mode toggle in mobile menu

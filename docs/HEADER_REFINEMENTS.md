# Header Refinements - October 14, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Logo Update ✅
**Before:** `urban-swing-logo.png` (transparent background, washed out)  
**After:** `urban-swing-logo-glow-black-circle.png` (black circle, better visibility)

**Result:** Logo now stands out clearly against the gradient background

---

### 2. Removed External Link Arrows ✅
**Issue:** Social media icons had arrows (↗) appearing after them

**Solution:** Added CSS rule to remove arrows from social icons:
```css
.social-icons a::after,
a.no-external-icon::after {
  content: none !important;
}
```

**Result:** Clean Facebook 'f' and Instagram camera icons without arrows

---

### 3. Tagline Text Update ✅
**Before:** "The Home of West Coast Swing in Hawkes Bay" (tacky/verbose)  
**After:** "West Coast Swing • Hawke's Bay" (clean/professional)

**Why this works better:**
- ✅ Shorter and more concise
- ✅ Clean bullet separator (•) is modern
- ✅ Still clearly states what the site is about
- ✅ Fixed spelling: "Hawke's Bay" (proper apostrophe)
- ✅ Professional and elegant
- ✅ Reads more like a subtitle than a slogan

**Alternative options considered:**
- "Modern Swing Dance • Hawke's Bay"
- "Dance with Us • West Coast Swing"
- Just remove it entirely (but you wanted WCS clarity near logo)

---

### 4. Header Compactness ✅
**Reduced spacing throughout:**

| Element | Before | After | Savings |
|---------|--------|-------|---------|
| Header padding | 24px / 40px | 16px / 24px | ~30% |
| Logo max-width | 400px | 280px | 30% |
| Logo margin-bottom | 16px | 8px | 50% |
| Text margin-bottom | 24px | 16px | 33% |
| Social icons gap | 40px | 24px | 40% |
| Social icon size | 44px | 40px | 10% |
| Nav top margin | 24px | 16px | 33% |

**Result:** Header takes up significantly less vertical space on laptop screens

---

### 5. Typography Refinements ✅
- Tagline font size reduced: `20px` → `16px`
- Font weight: `medium` → `normal` (less heavy)
- Letter spacing: added `0.5px` for elegance
- Opacity: `1.0` → `0.95` (subtle, not screaming)

---

## Mobile Optimizations
All sizes scale down proportionally on mobile:
- Logo: 220px max (was 300px)
- Text: smaller font sizes
- Icons: 36px (was 40px)
- Tighter spacing throughout

---

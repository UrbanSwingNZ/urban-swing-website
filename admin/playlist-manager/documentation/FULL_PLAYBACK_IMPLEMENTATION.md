# Full Track Playback Implementation Summary

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Spotify Web Playback SDK Integration**
Full track playback using Spotify's official Web Playback SDK.

**New Files:**
- `spotify-player.js` - Complete player module handling all playback functionality

**Features:**
- ✅ Play full tracks (not just 30-second previews)
- ✅ Play/pause toggle
- ✅ Automatic track switching
- ✅ Error handling for non-Premium accounts
- ✅ Fallback to 30-second previews if Premium not available

### 2. **Fixed: Playlist Persistence on Refresh**
Your playlist selection is now remembered across page refreshes.

**Behavior:**
- ✅ Refresh page → Returns to last viewed playlist
- ✅ Disconnect from Spotify → Clears saved playlist
- ✅ Navigate away then back → Starts fresh with "Select a playlist"

**Files Modified:**
- `playlist-operations.js` - Saves/loads last viewed playlist
- `playlist-auth.js` - Clears saved playlist on disconnect

### 3. **Updated Scopes for Full Playback**
Added required permissions for Spotify Web Playback SDK.

**New Scopes:**
- `streaming` - Required for Web Playback SDK
- `user-modify-playback-state` - Control playback
- `user-read-currently-playing` - Know what's playing

**Files Modified:**
- `spotify-config.js` - Added streaming scopes
- `index.html` - Added Spotify Web Playback SDK script

### 4. **Play Buttons Now Work for All Tracks**
Every track now has a play button (no more "preview_url required").

**How It Works:**
- Click play → Plays full track through Spotify
- Click pause → Pauses playback
- Click another track → Switches to that track
- Switch playlists → Stops current playback

**Files Modified:**
- `track-operations.js` - Updated play button logic to use Web Playback SDK

## 🎯 Requirements

### Spotify Premium Required
The Spotify Web Playback SDK **requires a Premium account**. 

**If you have Premium:**
- ✅ Full tracks play
- ✅ No interruptions
- ✅ Full control

**If you don't have Premium:**
- ⚠️ Player initialization will fail (gracefully)
- 💡 App shows error message
- 🔄 Falls back to 30-second previews (if available)

## 📋 How to Test

### Step 1: Reconnect to Spotify
The scopes have changed, so you need to re-authorize:

1. Open the playlist manager
2. Click "Disconnect" if connected
3. Click "Connect Spotify"
4. Accept the new permissions (including "streaming")

### Step 2: Select a Playlist
1. Choose any playlist from the sidebar
2. Wait for tracks to load

### Step 3: Play a Track
1. Hover over any track
2. Click the green play button ▶️
3. Track should start playing immediately

### Step 4: Test Controls
- **Click pause** → Pauses track
- **Click play on another track** → Switches tracks
- **Refresh page** → Returns to same playlist
- **Disconnect** → Clears playlist memory

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Spotify Premium is required for full playback"
**Cause:** You don't have a Premium account  
**Solution:** Either:
- Upgrade to Premium (€10.99/month)
- App will fall back to 30-second previews automatically

### "Player not ready. Please try again in a moment."
**Cause:** Web Playback SDK still initializing  
**Solution:** Wait 2-3 seconds and try again

### Play button doesn't appear
**Cause:** Old authentication without new scopes  
**Solution:** Disconnect and reconnect to get new permissions

### Nothing plays when clicking button
**Open DevTools Console (F12) and check for:**
- Red errors about authentication → Reconnect
- "Account Error" → Premium required
- "Initialization Error" → SDK loading issue, refresh page

## 🎵 What You Can Do Now

### Basic Playback
- ✅ Play full tracks (Premium only)
- ✅ Pause/resume playback
- ✅ Switch between tracks

### Automatic Features

- ✅ Button states update automatically (play ↔ pause)
- ✅ Only one track plays at a time

### Persistence

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

# Playlist Ownership Detection Implementation

## Overview
Implemented playlist ownership detection to control which context menu options are available based on whether the current user owns the playlist.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management (`playlist-state.js`)
- Added `currentUserId` state variable to store the authenticated user's Spotify ID
- Added `setCurrentUserId()` and `getCurrentUserId()` functions
- Created `isPlaylistOwnedByCurrentUser(playlist)` helper function that compares playlist owner ID with current user ID

### 2. Playlist Operations (`playlist-operations.js`)

#### Load Playlists
- Modified `loadPlaylists()` to fetch current user information via `spotifyAPI.getCurrentUser()`
- Store current user ID in state for ownership comparison

#### Playlist Context Menu
- Updated `showPlaylistMenu()` for both desktop and mobile:
  - **Owned playlists**: Show "Rename" and "Delete" options
  - **Followed/collaborative playlists**: Show only "Remove from Library" option
  
#### Remove from Library
- Added `handleRemovePlaylistFromLibrary()` function to unfollow playlists
- Uses existing `spotifyAPI.deletePlaylist()` method (which unfollows the playlist)
- Clears current playlist if it was selected
- Updates playlist list after removal

### 3. Track Operations (`track-operations.js`)

#### Desktop Track Menu
- Updated `showTrackMenu()` to conditionally show "Move to Playlist" option
- "Copy to Playlist" and "Delete" options always available
- "Move to Playlist" only shown if current playlist is owned by user

#### Mobile Track Menu
- Updated `showMobileTrackMenu()` with same ownership logic
- Dynamically builds options array based on ownership status

## User Experience

### Owned Playlists
Right-click (or long-press on mobile) shows:
- **Playlist Menu**: Rename, Delete
- **Track Menu**: Copy to Playlist, Move to Playlist, Delete

### Followed/Collaborative Playlists
Right-click (or long-press on mobile) shows:
- **Playlist Menu**: Remove from Library
- **Track Menu**: Copy to Playlist, Delete (no Move option)

## Technical Notes

- Ownership determined by comparing `playlist.owner.id` with `currentUserId`
- Current user ID fetched once during playlist load
- All menus (desktop/mobile, playlist/track) respect ownership rules
- "Remove from Library" uses the same API endpoint as "Delete" (unfollows the playlist)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with playlists you own (created by you)
2. Test with playlists you follow from other users
3. Test with collaborative playlists
4. Verify correct menu options appear in both desktop and mobile views
5. Verify "Remove from Library" works correctly for followed playlists

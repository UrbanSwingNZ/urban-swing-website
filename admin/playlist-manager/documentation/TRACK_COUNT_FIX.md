# Track Copy/Move and Count Update Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Track Counts Not Updating
**Problem:** When copying or moving tracks between playlists, the track counts in the sidebar weren't updating.

**Solution:** 
- Created `updatePlaylistTrackCount(playlistId, delta)` function in `playlist-operations.js`
- This function updates both the state and the UI element for a playlist's track count
- Called after copy (+1 to destination) and move (+1 to destination, -1 from source) operations

### 2. Move Operation Only Copying
**Problem:** The move operation was actually working correctly at the API level (copy to destination, delete from source), but it appeared to only copy because:
- The track counts weren't updating
- The current playlist view wasn't refreshing

**Solution:**
- Confirmed the API `moveTrackToPlaylist()` method correctly adds to destination then removes from source
- Added track count updates for both playlists
- Ensured current playlist tracks reload after move operation

## Changes Made

### `playlist-operations.js`
- Added `updatePlaylistTrackCount(playlistId, delta)` function
  - Updates track count in state (allPlaylists array)
  - Updates track count in UI (playlist sidebar item)
  - Accepts positive or negative delta values

### `track-operations.js`
- Imported `updatePlaylistTrackCount` function
- Updated `handleConfirmAction()`:
  - **Copy operation**: Updates destination playlist count (+1)
  - **Move operation**: Updates both destination (+1) and source (-1) playlist counts
- Updated `removeTrackFromPlaylist()`:
  - Updates current playlist count (-1) after deletion

## How It Works

### Copy Operation
1. Track is added to destination playlist via Spotify API
2. Destination playlist count is incremented (+1) in UI and state
3. Success message shown

### Move Operation
1. Track is added to destination playlist via Spotify API
2. Track is removed from source playlist via Spotify API
3. Destination playlist count is incremented (+1)
4. Source playlist count is decremented (-1)
5. Current playlist view is reloaded to show the track removed
6. Success message shown

### Delete Operation
1. Track is removed from current playlist via Spotify API
2. Current playlist count is decremented (-1)
3. Current playlist view is reloaded

## Benefits
- ✅ Track counts always stay in sync with actual playlist contents
- ✅ No need to refresh entire playlist list
- ✅ Immediate visual feedback for all operations
- ✅ Move operation clearly shows track removed from source
- ✅ Lightweight updates (only affected playlists are updated)

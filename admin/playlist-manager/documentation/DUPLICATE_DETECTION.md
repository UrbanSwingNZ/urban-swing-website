# Track Duplicate Detection

## Overview
Implemented duplicate detection to prevent copying or moving tracks to playlists where they already exist.

## Changes Made

### `spotify-api.js`

#### New Method: `checkTrackExistsInPlaylist()`
```javascript
async checkTrackExistsInPlaylist(trackUri, playlistId)
```
- Fetches all tracks from the destination playlist
- Checks if the track URI already exists in the playlist
- Returns `true` if track exists, `false` otherwise
- Handles errors gracefully (returns `false` to allow operation if check fails)

#### Updated: `copyTrackToPlaylist()`
- Now checks for duplicates before copying
- Throws error if track already exists: `"Track already exists in the destination playlist"`
- Only adds track if it doesn't exist

#### Updated: `moveTrackToPlaylist()`
- Now checks for duplicates before moving
- Throws error if track already exists: `"Track already exists in the destination playlist"`
- Only performs move operation if track doesn't exist in destination

### `track-operations.js`

#### Updated: `handleConfirmAction()`
- Enhanced error handling to detect duplicate track errors
- Shows user-friendly message: `"This track already exists in the destination playlist"`
- Prevents track count updates if operation fails

## How It Works

### Copy Operation
1. User selects "Copy to Playlist" from track menu
2. User selects destination playlist
3. System checks if track already exists in destination
4. **If exists:** Shows error message, operation cancelled
5. **If not exists:** Track is copied, destination count updated

### Move Operation
1. User selects "Move to Playlist" from track menu
2. User selects destination playlist
3. System checks if track already exists in destination
4. **If exists:** Shows error message, operation cancelled, track stays in source
5. **If not exists:** Track is moved, counts updated for both playlists

## Benefits
- ✅ Prevents duplicate tracks in playlists
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Protects playlist integrity
- ✅ Prevents wasted API calls
- ✅ Track counts remain accurate (only updated on success)

## Error Handling
- If duplicate check fails (network error, permissions, etc.), operation proceeds
- This "fail open" approach ensures users can still use the feature even if the check fails
- All errors are logged to console for debugging

## User Experience
When attempting to copy/move a duplicate track:
1. Loading indicator shows briefly
2. Error message appears: "This track already exists in the destination playlist"
3. Modal remains open (can select different playlist)
4. No changes made to any playlist
5. Track counts remain unchanged

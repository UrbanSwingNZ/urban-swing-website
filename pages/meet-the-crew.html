              <h2 style="text-align: center;">Nicole</h2>
              <p>Dance has always been part of Nicole’s life — starting with ballet and jazz before diving into partner dance in 2004.
                After 12 years of Rock ‘n’ Roll and 7 years of Ceroc/Modern Jive (MJ), she discovered West Coast Swing (WCS)... and that was it. 
                Hooked. No turning back.</p>

              <p>For years, Nicole admired WCS from afar, watching endless YouTube videos of top dancers showing off insane technique and musicality.
                Now that she’s in it, she loves the freedom and creativity WCS allows — especially as a follow, where there’s space
                to add her own flavour.</p>
                
              <p>Along with her husband, Lance, Nicole remains active in MJ through dancing, teaching, and judging.
                But she’s especially excited to share the magic of WCS with the Urban Swing community. 
                Seeing new dancers hit those “aha!” moments — whether big or small — is what makes it all worthwhile.</p>

              <p>Lance started dancing Ceroc/Modern Jive in 2014 and started teaching in 2020 before starting West Coast Swing in 2023.</p>
              <p>He and his wife, Nicole, moved to Napier from Auckland mid-2024 with their daughter, Emily, to be closer to family.</p>
              <p>He still enjoys dancing Modern Jive and attends competitions around NZ regularly, but is excited to grow his WCS knowledge and pass it on to new dancers in Hawkes Bay.</p>

# Testing Plan: Centralized Utilities Library (Item #11)

**Created:** December 19, 2025  
**Updated:** December 20, 2025 (Added Test 2.8: Centralized Logout Handler)  
**Purpose:** Ensure the centralized utilities library refactoring doesn't break existing functionality  
**Estimated Testing Time:** 100-135 minutes (comprehensive test)

---

## 🎯 What Was Changed

The centralized utilities library consolidates **11+ duplicate functions** across **60+ instances**:
- `escapeHtml()` - XSS protection (10+ duplicates eliminated)
- `formatDate()` - Date formatting (7+ duplicates eliminated)
- `formatCurrency()` - Money display (3+ duplicates eliminated)
- `formatTimestamp()` - Firestore timestamps (4+ duplicates eliminated)
- `isValidEmail()` - Email validation (2+ duplicates eliminated)
- `showLoading()` - Loading states (8+ duplicates eliminated)
- `toTitleCase()` - Text capitalization (2+ duplicates eliminated)
- `handleLogout()` - Logout handler (12+ duplicates eliminated)
- Date utilities (isToday, getStartOfToday, etc.)

**What Happened:**
- ✅ Created `/js/utils/` directory with 6 specialized utility modules
- ✅ Migrated 17 files to import from centralized utilities
- ✅ Centralized handleLogout function across 12 additional files
- ✅ Deleted 5 old utils.js wrapper files
- ✅ Updated 7 HTML files to import from `/js/utils/index.js`
- ✅ All code now uses centralized utilities

**Risk Level:** LOW-MEDIUM - Most changes are internal, but testing critical paths is essential.

## Next Steps

### If All Tests Pass ✅

1. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: Complete centralized utilities library (Item #11)
   
   - Created /js/utils/ with 6 utility modules
   - Migrated 13 files to use centralized utilities
   - Deleted 5 legacy utils.js wrapper files
   - Updated 7 HTML files to import from centralized location
   - Eliminated ~150 lines of duplicated code
   - Comprehensive testing: All critical paths passing"
   ```

2. **Push to repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin refactor-centralised-utilities
   ```

3. **Mark Item #11 complete** in your refactoring tracking

4. **Celebrate!** You've successfully consolidated the utilities library! 🎉

### If Tests Fail ❌

1. **Document each issue:**
   - Page where issue occurred
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Console error messages (take screenshots)
   - Steps to reproduce

2. **Report issues** for fixing:
   - List all issues found above
   - Mark severity (Critical/Medium/Minor)
   - Provide screenshots of console errors

3. **Wait for fixes**, then re-test failed areas

4. **Once fixed, re-run full test** to confirm

---

## Important Notes

**Console Warning vs Error:**
- **Red errors** = Bad, must be fixed
- **Yellow warnings** = Usually okay, note them but may be pre-existing
- **Blue info messages** = Fine, informational only

**What "PASS" means:**
- Page loads without console errors
- Data displays correctly formatted
- User actions work as expected
- No regressions from before refactoring

**Testing Tips:**
- Test methodically - don't skip steps
- Mark checkboxes as you go
- If something seems wrong, check console first
- Take screenshots of any errors
- Don't assume - actually test each item

**Document Version:** 2.0 (Page-by-page testing flow)  
**Last Updated:** December 20, 2025

Before testing full user flows, verify core functions work in browser console:

### ✅ escapeHtml() - XSS Protection

**Test Cases:**

## 4. Browser Console Testing

### Quick Manual Tests

Run these in browser console on any page that loads the centralized utils:

```javascript
// Test imports
import { escapeHtml, formatCurrency, formatDate, formatTimestamp, isValidEmail, toTitleCase } from '/js/utils/index.js';

// Test escapeHtml
console.log('escapeHtml test:');
console.log(escapeHtml('<script>alert("xss")</script>'));
// Expected: &lt;script&gt;alert("xss")&lt;/script&gt;

// Test formatCurrency
console.log('formatCurrency test:');
console.log(formatCurrency(1234.56));
// Expected: $1,234.56

// Test formatDate
console.log('formatDate test:');
console.log(formatDate(new Date()));
// Expected: 19 Dec 2025 (or current date)

// Test toTitleCase
console.log('toTitleCase test:');
console.log(toTitleCase('john doe'));
// Expected: John Doe

// Test isValidEmail
console.log('isValidEmail test:');
console.log(isValidEmail('test@example.com')); // true
console.log(isValidEmail('invalid')); // false

// Test null handling
console.log('Null handling:');
console.log(escapeHtml(null)); // Expected: ''
console.log(formatDate(null)); // Expected: '-'
```

**Status:** ⏭️ Not tested yet

---

## 5. Edge Cases & Regression Tests

### Critical Edge Cases

Test these specific scenarios that often break:

#### 1. Null/Undefined Handling

- [ ] **`formatDate(null)`** - Should return "-", not crash
- [ ] **`formatCurrency(undefined)`** - Should handle gracefully
- [ ] **`escapeHtml(null)`** - Should return ""
- [ ] **`isValidEmail('')`** - Should return false

#### 2. Special Characters (XSS Prevention)

Test with these strings in ALL text inputs:

- `<script>alert('xss')</script>`
- `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
- `"><script>alert(1)</script>`
- `Hello & Goodbye`
- `"Double quotes" and 'single quotes'`

**Where to test:**
- Student names
- Transaction notes
- Concession names
- Any user-generated content

#### 3. Large Numbers

- [ ] **`formatCurrency(999999999)`** - Should format as `$999,999,999.00`
- [ ] **Very small:** `formatCurrency(0.01)` - Should be `$0.01`

#### 4. Date Edge Cases

- [ ] **Today's date** - Should format correctly
- [ ] **Year boundary:** `new Date('2024-12-31')` and `new Date('2025-01-01')`
- [ ] **Invalid date:** `new Date('invalid')` - Should handle gracefully

#### 5. Concurrent Snackbars

- [ ] **Trigger multiple snackbars rapidly** (e.g., spam a save button)
  - Should handle gracefully
  - Should not crash

#### 6. Loading State Cleanup

- [ ] **Trigger loading, then cause an error** - Spinner should still disappear
- [ ] **Navigate away during loading** - Spinner should clean up

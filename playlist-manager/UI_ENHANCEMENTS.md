# UI Enhancements Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ 1. Pause Button Always Visible When Track Is Playing
**Problem:** Pause button only appeared on hover, making it hard to identify which track was playing.

**Solution:** Added CSS rule to keep the pause button visible (opacity: 1) when track has the `.playing` class.

**File Modified:**
- `playlist-manager.css` - Line 917-920

**Behavior:**
- Play button appears on hover (as before)
- **When track is playing:** Pause button stays visible even without hover
- User can easily see which track is currently playing

---

### ✅ 2. Toggle Menu Open/Close
**Problem:** Clicking an open menu didn't close it - you had to click outside.

**Solution:** Added toggle logic to check if menu is already open and close it if clicking the same button.

**Files Modified:**
- `track-operations.js` - `showTrackMenu()` function (lines 353-362)
- `playlist-operations.js` - `showPlaylistMenu()` function (lines 404-413)

**Behavior:**
- **First click:** Opens menu
- **Second click (same button):** Closes menu
- **Click different button:** Closes old menu, opens new one
- **Click outside:** Closes menu (as before)

---

### ✅ 3. Fixed Cursor Behavior for Track Rows
**Problem:** Entire row showed drag cursor (four arrows), but only drag handle was draggable. Play/pause and menu buttons should show pointer hand.

**Solution:** Changed row cursor from `move` to `default`, letting individual elements control their cursors.

**File Modified:**
- `playlist-manager.css` - Line 751

**Cursor Behavior Now:**
- **Hover over drag handle:** Four-arrow move cursor ✋ (indicates draggable)
- **Hover over play/pause button:** Pointing hand cursor 👆 (indicates clickable)
- **Hover over menu button:** Pointing hand cursor 👆 (indicates clickable)
- **Hover anywhere else on row:** Default arrow cursor ➡️ (no interaction)

**CSS Already in Place:**
- Drag handle: `cursor: move;` (line 803)
- Buttons: `cursor: pointer;` (line 892)
- Row: `cursor: default;` (line 751 - changed from `move`)

## Summary

All three UI enhancements are complete and should make the interface more intuitive:

1. **Better visual feedback** - You can now easily see which track is playing
2. **More intuitive menus** - Click to open, click again to close
3. **Clearer interactions** - Cursor indicates what's draggable vs clickable

These are small but important UX improvements that make the app feel more polished! 🎉
